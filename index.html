        <h2>About Andrew</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Ohio and moved to Washington state just before the pandemic. I'm a big gamer -- really digging Valheim right now. I'm excited to keep exploring this new place I live in, and this new career that I'm building towards!</p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The Ohio State University - one year (comp sci/whatever)</li>
          <li>Kent State University - BS in Newspaper Journalism</li>
          <li>Code Fellows!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Job Experience</h2>
        <p>Mainly tech support but a variety of odd tech jobs as well. In high school I was really lucky to work for the "tech team" a bunch of students that the school district's technology director hired to do all kinds of computer and network setups on the cheap (because high-schoolers are way cheaper than regular IT professionals!).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>CDK Global // 2016-2019</li>
          <li>Atos (formerly Siemens Business Services) // 2009-2016</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Get hired as a developer (probably full-stack JavaScript, maybe Python?)</li>
          <li>Move into remote work pretty quickly so that I'm not commuting all over western Washington!</li>
