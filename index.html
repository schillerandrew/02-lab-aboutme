        <h2>About Andrew</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Ohio and moved to Washington state just before the pandemic. I'm a big gamer -- really digging Valheim right now. I'm excited to keep exploring this new place that I live in, and this new career that I'm building towards!</p>

      <div id="experience">
        <h2>Job Experience</h2>
        <p>Mainly tech support but a variety of odd tech jobs as well. In high school I was really lucky to work for the "tech team" a bunch of students that the school district's technology director hired to do all kinds of computer and network setups on the cheap (because high-schoolers are way cheaper than regular IT professionals!).</p>
